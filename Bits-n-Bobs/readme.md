# Bits and Bobs

Some shorter notes.

- Proof that there exists a topological group $G$ and cosets $K,L$ of $G$ which have empty interior, but with $K\cup L$ having non-empty interior.
- Remarks on semi-direct products of groups, and slight subtleties in the topological case.
- What do modules over the finite-rank operators on a Banach space look like?
