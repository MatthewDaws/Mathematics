# Quantum Graphs

> Quantum Graphs: using diagrams to move from adjacency matrices to subspaces

Some notes, inspired by work of Yamashita and Wasilewski, to support my talk at the [2025 Workshop on Quantum Graphs](https://sites.google.com/view/quantum-graphs-25/).

Much of this material is now available in my paper [arXiv:2511.23121 [math.OA]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23121).
