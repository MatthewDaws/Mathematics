# Mathematics

An experiment: some longer pieces of Mathematics which don't quite belong on the arXiv.

- [Bits and Bobs](https://github.com/MatthewDaws/Mathematics/tree/master/Bits-n-Bobs) : Much shorter notes collected together.
- [Fell Topology](https://github.com/MatthewDaws/Mathematics/tree/master/Fell-Topology) : Some notes on various meanings of the "Fell Topology".
- [Inductive Limits](https://github.com/MatthewDaws/Mathematics/tree/master/Inductive-Limits) : Some notes on inductive limits of Banach spaces.
- [Kaplansky Density](https://github.com/MatthewDaws/Mathematics/tree/master/Kaplansky) : An "elementary" proof of Kaplansky Density.
- [Kaplansky Density Counter-Examples](https://github.com/MatthewDaws/Mathematics/tree/master/Kaplansky2) : Some counter-examples to Kaplansky Density.
- [Operator Space Direct Sums](https://github.com/MatthewDaws/Mathematics/tree/master/OS-Direct-Sums) : Some notes on the $\ell^\infty$ and $\ell^1$ direct sums of operator spaces.
- [Quasi-Invariant Measures](https://github.com/MatthewDaws/Mathematics/tree/master/Quasi-Inv-Measures) : Brief notes on quasi-invariant measures on locally compact groups.
